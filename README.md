Animusuic is a website for otakus how loves anime song. 
This website is made using HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
I will not say like "this is a great platform to listen anime music", no I am not doing that, maybe in future.
I am building this website to improve my coding skills its still under development, hope one day this will be a great platform to listen anime song.
The overall user interface is very clean, simple and delightful. If you are a Demon Slayer fan you will love the user-interface.
